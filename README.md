The program is self-paced and involves completing tasks guided by pre-recorded videos and example answers from Cognizant's team. Upon completion, participants earn a certificate, which can be added to their resume and LinkedIn as an extracurricular activity. This program helps individuals stand out in applications, confidently answer interview questions, and explain why they are a good fit for a team.
